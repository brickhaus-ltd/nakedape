True is True
For me True is True
For you True is true
Where ever you'll be True is True
For Me. For You. Where ever. True. Is true.

Red white and blue.
If I am Me
You are You

Red white and blue. Still, true is true.
If I am Me and You are You
Then somewhere in this room
Is Rue.

Who?

Rue. And for that matter, Dennis too.
For, you see. If I am Me, and You are you, and Ru is Ru, then along with that True is still True in all things. Even red white and blue.
There is no difference between me and you

If Rue is Rue and that we know is true
Then whoever Rue is it will be true Rue, is Rue too.

Confusion is a fog, it can set in quickly.
I may have lost you then, but Ill need you with me in the end.
So listen.
And I will be Rob.
Rob who? Who I have been.
Rob who? My will from me to you.

If Rue is Rue, and I am Rob to you
It follows then theres no difference between me, you, or even Rue.
You may be scared; You couldnt fill those shoes
And you wont 
You cant
They werent made for you

IF he was Paul, who gave us Rue, or whomever Rodman prays to too
Then I am Robert, Pauls' son. Just like me. Just like you. Just like Rue.

I'll leave you now before it rings too true
I am Robert, the he who may be; and some do say she is Rue; "your just mad, can't both be Pauls' sons." -You ..not listening
Chances are high; we can both be kinder; even to you.
Just want us, too.
