They want to show you
We want you to know
I am going to tell you.

You'll hear the same story, mostly whispered and yelled.
You'll hear the same story, It's good versus evil.
That's not quite it just listen. I'll tell.

It's glory versus shame.
Heed this. Know it well.

The only difference you see; is glory is good, because that stays the same.
The trouble you'll face. That's with shame.

With shame people will tell you, that didn't go well.
You should have been better.
You could not have helped.

But thats a lie. We tell to ourselves.
Evil things, the way you know it won't ever be the way they show it.
Evil is when shame which feels just like truth begins to feel more like it's them who you need to blame.

If you can not hear me yet.
Your not to be blamed.
I'm only talking about one thing.
It is the truth.

You see; one thing can feel like both glory & shame.
