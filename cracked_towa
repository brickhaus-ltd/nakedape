cant see with those eyes its more with the brain;
powerful lies wrapped a hold and all around your mange;
contestable project ables swirlin round the drain;
when you test a fool get to know his braind;
on toppa you they'll chop at you before all that weight can land;
to stand so tall and powerful you've got to tie it back; see you play with just one hand;
dont test the fools projectibles arent as retractable as the testiments to the immpractibles;                                          [hate to belive that]
just bde scentd them food & check they're cool. we're not they're pairs and we don't pay rent;                                        [thank: your mom & dad & not your dad & ...yikes scary]
feed the people.
stupid. simple.
something like that.
i'd call it, comet come commit.
until there is only peace; there is no right to peace; only a pre-viewed ledge.
& they bof left
when it fell; they echoed
you saw it. i wept.

ACK
