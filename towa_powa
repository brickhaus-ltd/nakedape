cant see with those eyes its more with the brain;
powerful lies wrapped a hold and all around your mange;
contestable project ables swirlin round the drain;
when you test a fool get to know his braind;
on toppa you they'll chop at you before all that weight can land;
to stand so tall and powerful you've got to tie it back; 
so they can look at you and see us; 
thats not playing thats just a play with one hand;
dont test the fools projectibles arent as retractable as the testiments to the immpractibles;
just bdesentd them food & check they're cool. we're not they're pairs and we don't pay rent; [thank: your mom & dad & not your dad & ...yikes scary]
feed the people.
stupid. simple.
something like that.
