starving kids in africa
what make you mad about starving kids in africa?
is it the starving? their, kid-ness? perhaps the fact they are in africa?
it makes me mad because it is an en grosse breach of authority
such en grosse; is the breach
that mothers often go to it first as a reason they'll use for their kids to ..just-between-us get them to do a bid.
and it's the last thing they'll ever think, once of course -- thewye've got them all tucked in.
such en grosse; is the breach
that we would all like to think that isn't even half of it.
