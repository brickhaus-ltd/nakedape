if we dont open the windows
our children will sing those
same old nursery out of tunes; or those torturous lulls before goodbye;
                          [oh how those retorts-of-yours-sound-to-us? dull lull before good bye.]
if we dont open the windows
your children will sing those
god awful rackets where ever the sun goes when its time for them not to shine
if i dont open my windows
my children will sing those
god how i wish those things would just die.
