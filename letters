a letter for my father
you should have built with brick
you knew they wouldn't quit
you should have built with brick

a message for my son
forget about it
your an idiot
just run

a body for me
a place to sit
a sight to see

what did the people get
where did the village go
whats in the fodder

how do letters know
which way to go
how can i get

a message to my father.
