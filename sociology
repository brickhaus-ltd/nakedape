A: A wise old human [who happened to be something close to jewish] [& who happened to be a man] told me once, probably more than that but i wasnt listening all the time:
    Don't put all kinds of fucked up shit in your bread & wash your whole fuckin junk, not just your teeth & hands
    if you eat more vegetables then you also will have to do less killing, 
    & always stand on the things you trust but it is best to go over there and find out if you can 
    (he said it differently, in some clever way that made 'understanding' not actually be where you want to stand.)
    Also heard a bunch of other things that I've found useful but; your not actually listening.
