Fluids move easily.
Plastic is a long chain of polymers.

When you heat up a long chain polymer...
It does not become a fluid. It is made up of molecules that are "much too big" for that...think sticky & knotted instead.
When you continue to heat up long chain polymer...
Those big sticky knots start to fall apart ... un composing it self into parts it wasn't ever necessiarly made from but is made of
as those knots fall apart enough you will indeed get a fluid(s) from whatever long chain you heated...
those fluids names depend on the names of the chains of polymers you began with but that isnt really the point
the point is....
the reason your tupperware looks all janky....is cause it was starting to decompose. hopefully in your dishwasher and not in your food....
these are the sins of our fathers. forgive them as we forgive us.
we're all still here.
and we're all still tics.
heretic.
