If your not dead in three ...
For that thing you ...
Chances are ...
A sin.

This world wont kill you
You must do that yourself
Just carry your burdens
And this as well

Did I speak of a garden?
You were never ment to know that
You were never ment to see

Your already with a danger,  for more you wont have room.
Not even close, quietly the Manager laid out two old posts.

You are all ready to be living the death thats coming
A promise from a love of the living, is that it shall be slow

So shhh, don't worry
You shouldnt have bothered
You were never ment to know
