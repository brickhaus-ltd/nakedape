  Poison is a substance that is harmful or lethal to a living organism, 
  while medicine is a substance that promotes healing when ingested or consumed1. 
  The classification of a substance as poison or medicine depends on its intent: 
        life-saving intentions label it as medicine,[1]
        while harmful intentions designate it as poison[2.]
